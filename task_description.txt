Hello Evan,
 
Here is the task I was talking about earlier, feel free to send the results till Thursday.
 
Please write a Python Flask/Django application that presents your CV data:
1. As a JSON REST API with endpoints
    GET /personal,
    GET /experience,
    GET /education, ...
2. As a Flask CLI command that prints the data to the console
 
The CV data can be hard-coded in the code or read from disk.
You do not need to integrate with any database. Please include a
README file on how to start the REST API and how to execute the CLI command.
 
It’s not a problem if you do not manage to get to a working version.
Just send us the code you’ve written and describe the issue that is
blocking you
(
    Including Docker,
    formating/linting tools and
    unit tests will be appreciated
)
